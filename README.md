Art perception depends on how you feel

## SYNOPSIS

- It is always hard to decide what path to take.
Creativity is not something that quickly appears when you need it. For creativity to occur and develop, everything needs to align with yourself. Especially talking about emotions and thoughts.
- I have explored many ideas during these 10 workshops, but the one that drives me is giving people (the observer) the right to transform an idea that has been drawn.
- Therefore, I will express my enthusiasm for developing an idea that will include interactivity based on data.
- So far, this topic has developed an intriguing feeling that has brought my childhood art to a place where I could do something with it.
- Since I was a kid, I have wanted my pen drawings to come alive; I have tried to animate, colour, and transform them, but I am still not happy with those ideas.
- I joined this class because I got intrigued by creating art with a computer; I did not know anything related to coding. I was stubborn on the idea that my brain did not like those languages. However, I took the initiative this time.
- So far, I have been enjoying the frustration of learning how to code.
- On that path, I realised that complicated things may become more manageable; for example, I realised that I could have the chance to allow people to change my drawings as they wish. At that is somethings different. If I can provide their feelings, including reactions, to modify my paintings, I will finally create ART. It will not be only my feelings being expressed with ink on paper; society's emotions will transform my feelings to reflect what they feel.
